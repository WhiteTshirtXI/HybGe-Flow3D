# HybGe-Flow3D #

HybGe-Flow3D is a finite volume solver for laminar fluid flow in complex 3D and 2D geometries. Complex geometries are enforced through an immersed boundary representation. Addtionally, HybGe-Flow3D has modules for computing upscaled conductivity (constant or tensor) for connections to Pore-Network and Darcy Scale models.
